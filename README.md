## A Quick Note
The reason why (if you where wondering) none of the pull requests go through Travis CI or Circle CI before getting merged is because, first, we haven’t really figured it out yet (we’d love some help), second, the project is so small we don’t really need it (but we’d like it), third, we like testing out the builds ourself, so it fits really well. And that’s why!
